# Remove Pet Hair with Rubber Gloves
## Pet hair is a common problem with a simple solution

As much as we love our four-legged friends, pet hair can accumulate quickly. Skip spending extra money on tools and special attachments and use this simple hack to clean up after your fur babies. Simply wear rubber household gloves and run them over the surface of your furniture. The rubber will cause the pet fur to gather into a ball that can be easily thrown away.

## How to get dog hair out of a car
1. Seat covers. Prevention is better than cure, and for certain dog breeds, even constant brushing won’t stop the sheds, making opting for car seat covers an great option. Seat covers will keep the hair off your seats, and contain it to one area, making it much easier to address. At the end of the ride, simply vacuum the hair off the cover, or pop it out and into the wash. In a pinch, you can even use an old beach towel as a seat cover.
2. Balloons. The power of static, at work for you! Simply blow up a balloon, rub it over your car seats to create a static electric charge, and watch the dog hairs be lifted right off the upholstery. As hair gathers on the balloon, simply wipe it off and repeat until your seats are clean again. This method works great for loose hairs, but isn’t strong enough for embedded hairs.
3. Lint roller. If you’ve had a dog for any length of time, you know the power of a lint roller. Keep one in your car’s console for a quick fix for dog hairs after every trip. Simply expose the surface of the lint roller, and run it over your seats, picking up loose dog hair as you go.
4. Fabric softener spray. Not only do they make your clothes soft and smell nice, but fabric softener contains ingredients specifically designed to loosen hair. It’s a no-brainer for use in your car. Mix 2-3 teaspoons of your favorite fabric softener with water in a clean spray bottle. Spray the mixture onto your car seats, then wipe with a paper towel to loosen any stubborn hair. Finish with a quick vacuum, and your car will look (and smell) like new. Pro-tip: this method works best with upholstery, but not with leather car seats.
4. Vacuum. Sometimes, the obvious solutions are the best. Run to the car wash up the street to use their high powered vacuums, or invest in your own auto vacuum. Just be sure to find one that has an attachment with rubber bristles, as these are most effective at removing hair.
